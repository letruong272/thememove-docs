# Theme License

> It’s strongly recommended that you add your theme’s license key from within the License box of the ThemeMove Core. By adding your key, you will activate the remote theme updates and have access to our support team.

## Activate License Key

You can find your theme’s license key by checking your purchase receipt or signing in to [your ThemeMove account](https://thememove.com/dashboard/licenses/).

Copy this key and navigate to **ThemeMove Core > Welcome > License Key box**. Enter your license key and hit **Submit**.

If the license key is activated successfully, it should look like this:

## What is the license key for?

It is important to keep your license up to date in order to continue getting updates for your ThemeMove WordPress theme and support for any issues you may encounter. Renewing your license grants you access to support and updates for another year, including all updates for bug fixes and feature introductions.

Without a valid theme license, you will be unable to get support and auto-update notifications will not function.

> If your key is not activated after hitting the Submit button, simply refresh the page and try again. Sometimes it takes a second try to properly establish a connection with the activation server.

## What if my license key has expired?

After a year, license keys may be renewed. You will get a renewal notification on your WordPress dashboard if your license is about to expire, or has in fact expired.
