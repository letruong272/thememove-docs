# ThemeMove's Support System

All of [ThemeMove’s items](https://thememove.com/wordpress-themes/) come with **6 months of included** support and free lifetime updates for your theme.\
Once the 6 months of included support is up, you have the opportunity to extend support coverage up to 6 or 12 months further.\
If you choose to not extend your support, you will still be able to submit bug reports via email or item comments and still have access to our online documentation knowledge base and video tutorials.

We clarify item support policy [here](https://thememove.com/faqs/).

We have an advanced, secure ticket system to handle your requests. Support is limited to questions regarding the theme’s features or issues that are related the theme.

> **We are not able to provide support for code customizations or third-party plugins.**

- Error logs
- Specific browser or device involved if applicable
- Operating System version( Windows 8.1, Maverick etc), the model of the device( Ipad 3, Samsung Galaxy etc.), browser version( Safari 7, IE 11) etc. and screen resolution 1600/800 1440/900 etc.
