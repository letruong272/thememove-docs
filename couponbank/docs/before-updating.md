# Before Updating

**1. It is always recommended to backup your current setup**\
   We recommend you have a current backup of your site. You can install [this plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/) to create a backup for your site.

**2. Reset browser cache, server cache and plugin cache**\
   It is always recommended to reset your browser, plugin, and server cache when you update. Visual issues may happen and more often than not, its caused by caches, and they need to be emptied. Each browser allows you to remove cookies, history and other data. If your theme or ThemeMove Core version is not updated after uploading the new files, it is due to a server-side caching system. Some hosting providers have server-side cache systems installed to optimize the speed of content delivery, please clear any server-side cache or ask your host to do it.

**3. Required & recommended plugins must be updated**\
    When you update the theme, you will see a notification message in your admin telling you the required and recommended plugins need to be updated. Follow the onscreen prompts to install the plugin updates. We have listed some required plugins and they have to be installed and activated for theme features to work. Make sure you are always using the most recent version of these plugins. You will be prompted to install it upon installing or updating your theme. If you dismiss the prompt or do not see it, then you can go to **Plugins >> Installed Plugins >> Update Available** (if have) and update the plugins there.
