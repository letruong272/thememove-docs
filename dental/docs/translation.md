# Theme Localization

With our theme you can translate your site to any language or even multiple languages, it is 100% translation ready theme. 
This theme is localized, which means it can easily be translated in your own language (easy but quite time consuming). There are two ways to translate this theme: use [Poedit](https://poedit.net/) or [Loco Translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/).

## Poedit
Poedit software installed on your computer. Poedit is available on OS X and Windows and can be downloaded [from here](https://poedit.net/).

##### Step 1: Opening Your Theme’s Default Language Template

Open **Poedit** and select **Create new translation:**

A new window will pop up, select WordPress theme you want to translate. A Theme’s default translation template is located in `wp-content/themes/THEMEXXX/languages/THEMEXXX.pot`, where `THEMEXXX` is the name of your theme.

For example, `wp-content/themes/dental/languages/dental.pot`
