In this part, Iâ€™ll guide you through creating a simple page using Elementor page builder and Slider Revolution plugin.

[Elementor](https://elementor.com/) is one of the most widely used page-building plugins popular among WordPress users. There are two versions for this: Elementor and Elementor Pro. In Dental, we integrated Elementor Pro so that users can use it for free. The update of this plugin is conducted alongside updating Dental theme. For more information, kindly refer to this [link](https://docs.elementor.com/)

## Using template

Users can also save Elementor widgets from Dental demo as templates and reuse these templates in their new page. To do this, select Edit a specific demo page, choose a widget by clicking on Customize icon then **Save as Template.**
