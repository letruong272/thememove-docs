> After the demo data is installed successfully, you should use the [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/) plugin to regenerate all thumbnail sizes to make sure that everything works fine.

Finally, you should check the permalink one more time to make sure your website displays everything properly just as how it's supposed to be in the demo. Go to **Settings > Permalink**. Hit **Post name**.
