# ThemeMove's Support System

All of [ThemeMove’s items](https://thememove.com/wordpress-themes/) come with **6 months of included** support and free lifetime updates for your theme.\
Once the 6 months of included support is up, you have the opportunity to extend support coverage up to 6 or 12 months further.\
If you choose to not extend your support, you will still be able to submit bug reports via email or item comments and still have access to our online documentation knowledge base and video tutorials.

We clarify item support policy [here](https://thememove.com/faqs/).

We have an advanced, secure ticket system to handle your requests. Support is limited to questions regarding the theme’s features or issues that are related the theme.

!> **We are not able to provide support for code customizations or third-party plugins.**\
If you need help with anything other than minor customization of your theme, we suggest enlisting the help of a developer.

## Before You Submit Ticket

!> To help speed along your request, we require that you follow the steps below before posting a ticket in the help desk.

**Step 1**: Please take a moment to search [the articles](https://thememove.ticksy.com/articles/), as the answer to your question is likely already in here - nearly 8 % of all tickets opened are due to the issues described in our articles.

**Step 2**: If your question or issue has not been brought up, then please open a ticket with the following information:
- Your live site URL that shows the issue
- Your WordPress login credentials
- Did you install or update the theme? Using FTP or from the WordPress admin panel?
- Error logs
- Specific browser or device involved if applicable
- Operating System version( Windows 8.1, Maverick etc), the model of the device( Ipad 3, Samsung Galaxy etc.), browser version( Safari 7, IE 11) etc. and screen resolution 1600/800 1440/900 etc.
- Detailed information describing the issue
- Possible screenshots of the issue
- Please note that in most case the support staff cannot do much without this information. So to avoid unnecessary delays please provide the information above.
- Also please deactivate all the plugins that don't come with the theme, this will allow us to rule out any third party plugins conflict. We don't deactivate the plugins on a client's site, because sometimes this may cause unforeseen issues.
